# dino-page

I lost internet at my house one morning, and I decided to try to make a React-esque web page using only JS, HTML, and CSS. The JS file has all the components of the page and appends them onto the DOM. The HTML file, like in a React project, is mostly bare with just a root div where that content is appended. 

This was a fun little project because it helped me see the benefits of using a library like React to create reusable components without needing to run a lot of "createElement" operations which can be confusing. Managing the element attributes is also more clear using React
